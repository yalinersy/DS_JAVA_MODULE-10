# Ex23 Breadth-First Search (BFS) Traversal of a City Junction Map
## Date: 12.3.26
## AIM:
To design and implement a java program to perform Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal on a city’s junction map represented as a graph, and find all reachable locations from a given source junction.
## Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Represent the city junction map as a graph using an adjacency list (dictionary).
3. Define a function `bfs(graph, start)` that performs Breadth-First Search traversal:
   - Initialize a queue and a list to keep track of visited junctions.
   - Enqueue the starting junction.
   - While the queue is not empty:
     - Dequeue a junction and mark it as visited.
     - Print or store the junction in traversal order.
4. In the main section:
   - Define the city map as a graph (each node represents a junction).
   - Take a starting junction as input (or use a fixed source).
   - Call the `bfs()` function to display reachable locations.
5. Stop the program.

public class EmergencyRouteBFS {
    public static void addEdge(List<List<Integer>> g, int u, int v) {
        g.get(u).add(v);
        g.get(v).add(u);
    }

    public static void bfs(List<List<Integer>> g, int src, boolean[] visited) {
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(src);
        visited[src] = true;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int curr = q.poll();
            System.out.print(curr + " ");
            for (int neighbor : g.get(curr)) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    q.offer(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt(), e = sc.nextInt();
        List<List<Integer>> g = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) g.add(new ArrayList<>());
        for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) addEdge(g, sc.nextInt(), sc.nextInt());
        int src = sc.nextInt();
        bfs(g, src, new boolean[n]);
    }
}

```

## Result:
Thus, JAVA program has been successfully implemented and executed.
It performs Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal on a city junction map and correctly lists all reachable locations from the given source node.
